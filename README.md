# AI-Powered Smartphone Rating Tool 📱🤖

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how AI can be embedded directly into spreadsheets to perform intelligent analysis.

I built an AI-powered smartphone rating system using **Google Sheets and Google Apps Script**, integrated with the **Google Gemini API**, to automatically analyze smartphone specifications and generate meaningful insights.

## 🧠 What Does the AI Do?
For each smartphone record, the AI generates:

1. **AI_Rating**  
   - A numeric rating derived from technical specifications such as processor, RAM, battery, camera, and price.

2. **Worth_Verdict**  
   - A one-line AI-generated verdict evaluating whether the phone offers good value compared to market competition.
